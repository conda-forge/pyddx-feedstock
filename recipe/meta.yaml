  description: |
    ddX is an open-source software package for continuum solvation models based
    on the domain decomposition paradigm. It contains a common interface for
    the three different methods ddCOSMO, ddPCM and ddLPB for the numerical
    solution to the COSMO, PCM and LPB solvation models. ddX computes for these
    methods the electrostatic contribution to the solvation energy, the
    corresponding contribution to the forces and/or the contribution to the
    Fock- or DFT Kohn-Sham-matrix. Using the common interface, all three
    methods are accessible from a host-code that is used to model the solute
    and which can be on the level of QM, QM/MM, polarizable MM or MM, or as a
    standalone application.
